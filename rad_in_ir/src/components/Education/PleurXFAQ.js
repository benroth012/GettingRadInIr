    <h1><b>PleurX Catheter Frequently Asked Questions</b></h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <h4><b>How often should I drain the catheter?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to drain the catheter as often as directed by your health care team.</li>
        <li>To start, you will drain the catheter more often to help the fluid dry up,
        so the catheter can be removed.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>How do I put on a new dressing?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The catheter should always be covered by a 4 x 4 gauze pad.</li>
        <li>The clear adhesive dressing should cover the gauze. <b>Do not</b> put the
        clear adhesive dressing directly on the catheter.</li>
        <li>Ask for the patient education handout, “Caring for Your PleurX
        Drainage Catheter at Home”, to learn more about how to care for
        your catheter.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>What should I do if the dressing bothers me?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Call your doctor if the dressing causes problems with your skin. There
        are other dressing options that can be ordered by your doctor if your
        dressing irritates your skin.</li>
        <li><b>Do not</b> put creams or use skin products under the dressing.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>When is the blue clamp in the kit used?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The blue clamp is only used if your catheter is accidentally cut or
        damaged. The blue clamp keeps air from getting in the catheter. <b>If
        your catheter becomes damaged, put the clamp on and go to the
        emergency room.</b></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>Will I have pain when I drain the catheter?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>It is normal to have pain when you drain the catheter. At times, the
        pain may be severe.</li>
        <li>Stop the drainage <b>right away</b> if you have pain when you drain the
        catheter.</li>
        <li>Drain the fluid more slowly the next time you drain your catheter.</li>
        <li>It may help to take a pain pill 30 minutes before you drain your
        catheter.</li>
        <li>If you have pain that lasts more than a half hour after draining your
        catheter, call your doctor.</li>
        <li><b>Do not</b> drain more than 1,000mL of fluid from your chest at one time.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>How do I cover the stitches?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>To cover the stitches, increase the slit in the foam catheter pad to
        cover both stitches.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>Will the catheter leak?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The catheter may leak in the first 2 weeks.</li>
        <li>If it continues to leak after the first 2 weeks, call your doctor.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>What is the normal color of the fluid?</b></h4>
      The fluid from your drain may be yellow, green, or look like blood. The
      fluid may have blood in it at any time. It is normal to see blood clots or
      tissue when you drain the catheter.
