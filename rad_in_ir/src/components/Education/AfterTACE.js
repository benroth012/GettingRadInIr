        <h1><b>Taking Care of Yourself After TACE</b></h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            After having your TACE (Transarterial Chemoembolization) treatment,
            you may have some of the following side effects:
            <ul>
                <li>Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach)</li>
                <li>Pain in your stomach, right side, back or right shoulder</li>
                <li>Constipation (not able to have a bowel movement)</li>
                <li>Fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher</li>
                <li>Fatigue (feeling very tired)</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            Your doctor may prescribe the following medicines to help with your nausea:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Promethazine (phenergan) -</b> You should take this medicine first,
                    if you are feeling sick to your stomach. You may take 1 pill every 6
                    hours when you are feeling sick. These pills can make you dizzy and
                    sleepy, so be careful when you take them. When the nausea goes
                    away, stop taking this medicine.
                </li>
                <li><b>Ondansetron (zofran) -</b> If your nausea continues after taking the
                    Phenergan, then your doctor may tell you to take Zofran. Take 1 pill
                    every 6 hours as needed, when you are feeling sick.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Nausea/Vomiting</b></h4>
            If you are having these problems, here are some things you can do to help.
            <ul>
                <li>If you have nausea or vomiting, try to take your anti-nausea medicine and rest your stomach for 30
                    to 60 minutes
                </li>
                <li>Try to drink fluids. You need to drink 8 ounces (1 cup) of fluid every 2 hours to stay hydrated.
                </li>
                <li>Drink liquids like cool water, diluted juice, sport’s drinks (Gatorade), tea, or any non-alcoholic
                    fluid that you feel you can keep down.
                </li>
                <li>If you can, try some soup/broth, jello or popsicles. Add crackers or plain toast when you are
                    feeling better.
                </li>
                <li>Eat and drink small amounts during the day.</li>
                <li>When you start to feel better, you may try the following: cereal,
                    oatmeal, a baked potato, scrambled eggs, yogurt, pudding and rice.
                    Continue eating these foods until you feel like eating your regular
                    diet.
                </li>
                <li>Some medicines can upset your stomach. It may help to take pills with crackers or other bland solid
                    food.
                </li>
                <li>Do not eat spicy, greasy or fried foods when you have nausea.</li>
                <li>You may take an antacid (Tums, Maalox) if it helps settle your stomach.</li>
            </ul>
            Loss of body fluids (dehydration) can be a problem when you are
            vomiting. <b>If you are not able to drink fluids for several hours, call the
            doctor.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Pain</b></h4>
            You may have pain in your stomach, right side, back or right shoulder.
            <ul>
                <li>Your doctor has given you a prescription for Roxycodone. If your
                    pain is severe, you should take your prescription pain medicine as
                    directed. If this medicine does not help reduce your pain, call your
                    doctor.
                </li>
                <li>Strong pain medicine can make you dizzy or feel “foggy”. Be very
                    careful when you take this medicine.
                </li>
                <li>When taking a strong pain medicine, you need to take a stool
                    softener such as Colace to help avoid constipation. Take 1 pill in the
                    morning and 1 pill in the evening.
                </li>
                <li>When you have less pain, you may take Tylenol (acetaminophen)
                    or Advil/Motrin as directed on the bottle. Do not take more than
                    2000mg of Tylenol (acetaminophen) per day.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Constipation</b></h4>
            Constipation is not being able to have a bowel movement. Constipation may be caused by:
            <ul>
                <li>Taking strong pain medicine</li>
                <li>Taking strong nausea medicine</li>
                <li>Not drinking enough fluids</li>
                <li>Not being active</li>
                <li>Not eating enough fiber</li>
                <li>Your disease</li>
            </ul>
            <b>To help manage constipation:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Drink plenty of fluids (1 cup every two hours). Warm or hot liquids work better.</li>
                <li>Eat fruits and vegetables to add fiber to your diet.</li>
                <li>When you are able, add activity (walking) during your day.</li>
                <li>Take a stool softener or a laxative-type medicine. You do not need a prescription for these.</li>
                <li>Everyone’s body works differently, so you may need to try a few
                    different laxative-type medicines (Colace, Miralax, or Senna) to find
                    the one that works for you.
                </li>
                <li>Some liver cancer patients use a different laxative-type medicine
                    called lactulose. This requires a prescription from your doctor. This
                    medicine may be taken up to 4 times a day if constipated.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Fevers</b></h4>
            A high temperature or fever is common after this treatment. If you have
            a fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher, you
            may take Tylenol or Advil. If the fever continues after taking medicine,
            call your doctor.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Fatigue</b></h4>
            It is normal to feel very tired for several weeks after this treatment. Your
            arms and legs may feel very heavy and you may feel sad or depressed.
            To help manage these symptoms:
            <ul>
                <li>Get out of bed each morning.</li>
                <li>Shower or bath each day.</li>
                <li>Walk or exercise.</li>
                <li>Eat a good diet.</li>
                <li>Drink supplements like Boost, Ensure or Carnation Instant Breakfast.</li>
                <li>Get a good night’s rest. Limit naps during the day so you are able to sleep well at night.</li>
                <li>Let your friends and family help you with household tasks and errands during your recovery.</li>
            </ul>
