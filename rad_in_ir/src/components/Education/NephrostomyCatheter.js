        <h1><b>Home Care for Your Nephrostomy Catheter - The James</b></h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            <h4><b>What can I expect after this procedure?</b></h4>
            You were given medicine through your IV to help you relax during the
            placement of your catheter. This medicine may cause you to feel sleepy,
            dizzy or tired for hours after the procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>During the first 24 to 48 hours after this procedure you should do the following:</b></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Go home and rest for the remainder of the day.</li>
                <li><b>Do not</b> drive or work around any mechanical equipment, sharp
                    objects, power tools or appliances until the day after your procedure.
                </li>
                <li><b>Do not make any major life or legal decisions for at least 24 hours</b>
                    after your procedure because the medicine you were given may
                    make you unable to think clearly or remember your actions.
                </li>
                <li>Eat light foods, like jell-o, pudding, soups, juices and other liquids.
                    Return to your normal diet as tolerated.
                </li>
                <li>After your procedure, you will be told if you need to wait before
                    you restart your normal medicines. It is important to drink water to
                    help get rid of the dye from your body.
                </li>
                <li>The area where the IV was used for the procedure may be tender for
                    a day or two. Use warm moist compresses on the area for 20 minutes
                    every day. If the area gets more red, swollen or tender after 2 or 3
                    days, call your doctor.
                </li>
                <li>Bruising or tenderness where the nephrostomy catheter was placed
                    is common. The area may have very mild bruising or become black
                    and blue. The bruising can be as large as the size of a golf ball. These
                    signs may last for 2 weeks or longer. Apply warm moist compresses
                    to the area for 20 minutes 2 or 3 times a day to help with this
                    problem. <b><u>Be sure to cover your dressing with plastic wrap first to
                        keep it dry.</u></b></li>
                <li><b>Check your temperature each day</b> the catheter is in place.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Call (614) 293-2773 or go to the nearest Emergency Room if you
                have any of the following during the first 4 to 8 hours after your
                nephrostomy catheter was put in:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Active bleeding at the catheter site that does not stop when you put finger pressure on the area
                </li>
                <li>Increased pain or swelling at or around the catheter site</li>
                <li>Fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 Celsius) or higher with or without chills</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Skin Care and Showering</b></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep the area where the nephrostomy catheter is placed dry.</li>
                <li>You may take a shower 48 hours after your procedure, but you need
                    to keep the area dry while in the shower.
                </li>
                <li>Before you shower, cover the catheter dressing and the skin around
                    the area with plastic wrap taped to your skin. <b><u>You must cover the
                        area when showering for 14 days after your procedure.</u></b></li>
                <li>After 14 days, if the area has healed, you can shower without the
                    dressing and plastic wrap. At the end of your shower, use a clean
                    washcloth and liquid antibacterial soap, such as Dial, with water to
                    clean the area around your catheter. Then rinse the area well with
                    plain water and pat gently with a towel to dry.
                </li>
                <li><b>Do not</b> bathe in a tub, use a hot tub or swim as long as you have the
                    catheter in place.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Dressing Change</b></h4>
            A gauze dressing should be changed every other day, but if you have
            a transparent dressing, it is changed every 72 hours. Either type of
            dressing should be changed if it gets wet or the edges become loose.
            <br/>
            <b>Steps</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather your supplies.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 pairs of non-sterile gloves</li>
                    <li>Cotton swabs or clean washcloths</li>
                    <li>Antibacterial soap</li>
                    <li>4x4 gauze split dressings (package of two)</li>
                    <li>Paper tape if gauze dressing is used</li>
                    <li>Small plastic garbage bag</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Wash your hands with soap and water for 15 seconds. Rinse and towel dry.</li>
                <img src={nephrostomy_catheter1} style={{float: `right`, height: `175px`}}/>
                <li>Put on the non-sterile gloves.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the old dressing to prevent pulling the catheter out.
                    Check the skin around the tube for any redness, swelling, warmth or
                    a bad smelling drainage. These problems may be a sign of infection.
                    If you have any of these problems, clean the skin and change the
                    dressing more often for one week. If the signs do not improve right
                    away, call your doctor.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the non-sterile gloves and wash your hands again. Then put
                    on the other clean pair of gloves.
                </li>
                <img src={nephrostomy_catheter2} style={{float: `right`, height: `200px`}}/>
                <li>Clean the skin around the catheter. Start at the center where the tube
                    comes out of the skin. Use a circular motion to clean the skin around the
                    tube. Slowly move out and away from the tube 3 to 4 inches. Do not
                    clean back towards the tube. Let the skin dry. Do not fan the area to speed
                    the drying because that will put more germs near the site. If the antibacterial
                    soap irritates your skin, use sterile saline to clean the area. Do not
                    use alcohol, peroxide or betadine to clean the area around the
                    catheter. These products can cause your skin to become irritated.
                </li>
                <img src={nephrostomy_catheter3} style={{float: `right`, height: `175px`}}/>
                <li>Open the 4 x 4 split gauze dressing package and remove
                    the gauze pad. Touch only the edges of the gauze pad. Put the
                    gauze around the tube as shown in the picture.
                </li>
                <img src={nephrostomy_catheter4} style={{float: `right`, height: `175px`}}/>
                <li>If you are directed to use a second split gauze dressing,
                    place it over the first gauze dressing. Place the second
                    gauze to cover the tube as shown in the picture.
                </li>
                <img src={nephrostomy_catheter5} style={{float: `right`, height: `175px`}}/>
                <li>Tape the dressing in place. If you are to cover the whole dressing,
                    use 3 pieces of tape. Put the first piece of tape where the tube
                    comes out from under the dressing. Pinch the tape around
                    the tube so it will not move if it gets pulled.
                </li>
                <img src={nephrostomy_catheter6} style={{float: `right`, height: `175px`}}/>
                <li>Put the second piece of tape over the center of the dressing
                    so the edges of the tapes just overlap.
                </li>
                <img src={nephrostomy_catheter7} style={{float: `right`, height: `175px`}}/>
                <li>Then put a third piece of tape to cover the rest of the dressing.</li>
                <li>Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Rinse and towel dry.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Care of Your Drainage Bag</b></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Empty your drainage bag as often as needed when it is about
                    2/3 full. Turn the blue knob at the bottom of the bag and drain it
                    into a measuring container. Keep track of the amount of drainage
                    each day.
                </li>
                <li>You should not clean the drainage bag. You will be sent home with
                    an extra drainage bag to use if there is a leak in the bag or the bag
                    or tubing gets damaged.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Special Precautions and Problems</b></h4>
            <img src={nephrostomy_catheter8} style={{float: `right`, height: `300px`}}/>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep the drainage bag below the level of your
                    kidneys at all times, to prevent a back flow of
                    urine into the kidneys. <b>Note:</b> your drainage bag
                    may be different from the one in the picture.
                </li>
                <li>To prevent sludge and calculi or stones from forming, drink 6 to 8
                    glasses (8-ounce glass) of fluids a day.
                </li>
                <li>Keep your nephrostomy catheter drainage bag closed to reduce risk of infection.</li>
                <li>Keep the nephrostomy catheter and drainage bag tubing free of twists, kinks or leaks.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
