            <h4><b>What is a biliary drain?</b></h4>
            A biliary drain allows bile to flow out from a blocked bile duct into a collection bag outside the body.
            Bile is a liquid
            made by the liver. It helps digest fats. Blocked or narrowed bile ducts can stop the flow of bile and cause
            yellowing
            of the skin (jaundice) or an infection of the liver.
            <br/>
            The drain is a thin plastic tube (catheter) that the doctor places in the bile duct. From there the tube
            passes out
            through a drain site on your skin and into a collection bag. The bag may be attached to a belt or strapped
            to the leg.
            About 2 to 4 cups of bile will collect in the bag each day. The amount should be fairly constant from day to
            day.
            <br/>
            The bile that comes out of the drain may look bloody at first, but it will soon change to its normal
            yellow-green color.
            <br/>
            How long the drain stays in place depends on what caused the problem with your bile duct. Your doctor will
            discuss this with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>How can you care for your biliary drain at home?</b></h4>
            Your doctor or ostomy nurse can answer any questions you have about caring for your drain or bag.
            <ol>
                <li>Learn to change the bandage. You may have a bandage on your skin where the tube comes out of your
                    body. Your doctor will
                    tell you how often to change it. To change the bandage:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
                    <li>Take off the bandage from around the drain.</li>
                    <li>Use gauze or a cotton swab to clean the drain site and the skin around it with soap and water.
                    </li>
                    <li>When the site is dry, you can put on a new bandage. First, cut a slit in the bandage, and then
                        fit it around the drain site.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>Keep the tube clear. To clear the tube, flush it with sterile saline. Your doctor will tell you how
                    and when to do this.
                </li>
                <li>Empty the bag as needed. Empty the bile from your bag when it's about 2/3 full, or at least once a
                    day.
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
                    <li>If your doctor requested it, make a note of the amount of bile in the bag.</li>
                    <li>Open the drainage port at the bottom of the bag.</li>
                    <li>Empty the contents of the bag into the toilet.</li>
                    <li>Clean the drainage port with soap and water, and close it.</li>
                    <li>Wash your hands again with soap and water.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            If the bag breaks or tears, replace it as soon as possible.
