        <h1>Tunneled Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Placement</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            A tunneled <b>Central Venous Catheter (CVC)</b> is a special type of
            intravenous (IV) line that is placed into a large vein in your chest. A long,
            thin, flexible tube called a catheter is tunneled under your skin and then
            placed into the vein. You may hear this type of line called a Central line,
            PowerLine, Hickman or an Apheresis Catheter.
            <br/>
            A tunneled CVC can be used over a long period of time. It may stay in
            place as long as you need it and it is working well. The type of CVC and
            how it is used will depend on your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A tunneled CVC may be used for:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Chemotherapy treatment</li>
                <li>Taking blood samples</li>
                <li>Blood transfusions</li>
                <li>Giving IV fluids or IV medicines</li>
                <li>Hemodialysis</li>
                <li>Total Parental Nutrition (TPN)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><b>Types of Tunneled Central Venous Catheters</b></h4>
            There are different types of tunneled CVCs. Your doctor will talk with
            you about which type is best for you.
            <ul>
                <li>A tunneled CVC may have a small <b>cuff</b> around the catheter. The cuff
                    sits inside the skin tunnel. It helps to secure the catheter in place and
                    prevent infection.
                </li>
                <li>A long thin hollow tubing comes out of the skin called a <b>lumen.</b> A
                    tunneled CVC may have one lumen (single) or can split into two or
                    three separate lumens (double or triple lumens). An injection <b>cap</b> will
                    cover the end of each lumen.
                </li>
                <li><b>Open-ended catheters</b> have small clamps that close off the catheter
                    when it is not in use. A Hickman or Apheresis catheter are types of
                    open-ended catheters.
                </li>
                <li><b>Closed-ended catheters</b> do not have clamps. Closed ended
                    catheters have a special valve at the tip of the catheter that closes it
                    off. A PowerLine is a type of closed ended catheter.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>How is a Tunneled CVC Placed?</b></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A tunneled CVC can be put in by a doctor in the operating room or in
                    the Radiology Department.
                </li>
                <li>An IV will be put into your arm. You will be given medicine to help you
                    relax and you may feel drowsy.
                </li>
                <li>The skin on your neck and chest will be cleaned with a special
                    antibacterial soap.
                </li>
                <li>A numbing medicine will be given to decrease any discomfort. This
                    medicine will numb the skin on your chest, neck and shoulder.
                </li>
                <li>Two small incisions are made during the procedure:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>One incision <b>(insertion site)</b> will be made at the bottom of your neck near your
                        collarbone.
                    </li>
                    <img src={tunneled_cvc2} style={{float: `right`, height: `320px`}}/>
                    <li>A second incision <b>(exit site)</b> will be made on your chest a few inches above your nipple.
                        This is where the catheter comes out of your body.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>A tunnel is then made under your skin between the two incisions. The catheter will be pulled
                    through the tunnel and then put into a large vein just above your heart. This tunneling helps to
                    hold the catheter in place.
                </li>
                <li>The incisions will be closed and held together by stitches, special
                    surgical glue or steri-strips (small tapes). Both incisions are covered
                    with a small gauze dressing. The catheter line will be taped to your
                    chest to help hold it in place.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>What to Expect After a Tunneled CVC Placement</b></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You may have some bruising, swelling and tenderness where the
                    catheter was put in. These symptoms should go away after 1 to 2
                    days.
                </li>
                <li>You may have some mild discomfort where the CVC was placed.
                    Talk to your doctor about what you can do to help with any pain or
                    soreness.
                </li>
                <li>Your incisions should heal in about 7 to 10 days.</li>
                <li>You will be told when to change to a new dressing.</li>
                <li>If the dressing becomes wet, loose or falls off, put on a clean dressing
                    and tape it securely in place.
                </li>
                <li>Do not remove the incision steri-strips (small tapes). They will fall off
                    on their own in about a week or more.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Activity Limits with Your Tunneled CVC</b></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A CVC should not change most of your daily activities. You do not
                    need to wear special clothing.
                </li>
                <li><b>Do not do strenuous exercises or activities for a few weeks to allow
                    your incisions to heal.</b> These activities may cause the catheter to be
                    pulled out. Talk to your doctor about any restrictions with activities,
                    exercises and sports with a CVC.
                </li>
                <li>You may take a shower with a tunneled catheter in place. You need to
                    keep the dressing and the catheter area dry.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each time you shower, cover the CVC site with a new piece of
                        plastic wrap. Tuck all lumens of the catheter under the plastic
                        wrap and tape the edges down. This keeps the dressing and
                        catheter dry.
                    </li>
                    <li>To reduce the chance of infection, use the same roll of plastic
                        wrap to cover your CVC each time. Do not use this roll of plastic
                        wrap for kitchen use or cooking.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Do not</b> take a tub bath, swim or do activities that may cause the CVC
                    site to become wet or dirty.
                </li>
                <li><b>Do not use sharp objects like scissors or a razor near your CVC.</b></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>How to Care for Your Tunneled CVC</b></h4>
            Your CVC will need special care to keep it clean and working well. CVC
            care can be done by you, a caregiver or a nurse. You and your caregiver
            will be taught how to care for your tunneled CVC before you go home.
            <br/>
            This care includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Cleaning and changing the dressing site</li>
                <li>Flushing the lumen(s)</li>
                <li>Changing the cap(s)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Call for Emergency Help (911) if you have:</b></h4>

                    clean bandage (dressing), hold pressure on the site and then call your
                    doctor.
                </li>
