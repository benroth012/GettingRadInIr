In this directory lies the front-end portion of our application.

The front end is made using React. You will need Node and npm downloaded to run a React app. We are using node V15.12.0 and npm V7.6.3, but the version likely won’t be an issue since we didn’t use any cutting-edge features.

For more information about this project as a whole, please refer to the provided document titled "Documentation Guide"

For more technical information about this project, please refer to the provided document titled "Developers Manual"

# Initial Setup Instructions

If you don’t already have node downloaded, there is a lot of documentation online about how to download it based on whether you use Mac or Windows:

https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
This is the official node and npm download instructions

https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html
This is the way some of us downloaded node, using a program called Homebrew, which makes things easier

Type “node -v” and “npm -v” into the terminal to make sure you have them installed

We recommend using Visual Studio Code for this project

Navigate into the folder rad_in_ir (this is the front end)

Type “npm install” into the Visual Studio Code terminal

Type “npm run” into the Visual Studio Code terminal

The application should be running on http://localhost:3000/

These steps will only run the front end of our app, but a lot of parts will not display unless the back-end is running simultaneously.

We used React Bootstrap for a lot of our display features, so that they are reactive and look consistent. The React Bootstrap documentation can be found here: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts 

# Running Instructions

After initial setup, to run in the future, all that is required is typing "npm start" in the terminal while located in the top level of the rad_in_ir directory.



# EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS ADDITIONAL COMMANDS FROM THE REACT CREATORS

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
