      <h4><b>What is a vena cava filter?</b></h4>
      A vena cava filter may help prevent blood clots from traveling to the lungs, where they may block blood flow.
      <br />
      Your doctor removes the filter using a thin, flexible tube called a catheter. This goes into your vein. A removable filter 
      has a small hook on it. The doctor can use the hook to help pull the filter out of the vein.
      <br />
      A filter may be taken out because it can cause problems if you have one for a long time. It can break or become 
      blocked with one or more blood clots. This can be serious.
      <br />
      You may go home the same day after the procedure. You may be able to go back to work or your normal 
      routine in a day or two.
      <br />
      <b>Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety.</b> Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your 
      doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the 
      medicines you take.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>How do you prepare for the procedure?</b></h4>
      Procedures can be stressful. This information will help you understand what you can expect. And it will help you 
      safely prepare for your procedure.
      <br />
      <b>Preparing for the procedure</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Be sure you have someone to take you home. Anesthesia and pain medicine will make it unsafe for 
          you to drive or get home on your own.</li>
        <li>Understand exactly what procedure is planned, along with the risks, benefits, and other options.</li>
        <li>Tell your doctor ALL the medicines, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies you take. Some 
          may increase the risk of problems during your procedure. Your doctor will tell you if you should stop 
          taking any of them before the procedure and how soon to do it.</li>
        <li>If you take aspirin or some other blood thinner, ask your doctor if you should stop taking it before 
          your procedure. Make sure that you understand exactly what your doctor wants you to do. These 
          medicines increase the risk of bleeding.</li>
        <li>Make sure your doctor and the hospital have a copy of your advance directive. If you don't have one, 
          you may want to prepare one. It lets others know your health care wishes. It's a good thing to have 
          before any type of surgery or procedure.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>What happens on the day of the procedure?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow the instructions exactly about when to stop eating and drinking. If you don't, your procedure 
          may be canceled. If your doctor told you to take your medicines on the day of the procedure, take 
          them with only a sip of water.</li>
        <li>Follow your doctor's instructions about when to bathe or shower before your procedure. Do not apply 
          lotions, perfumes, deodorants, or nail polish.</li>
        <li>Take off all jewelry and piercings. And take out contact lenses, if you wear them.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>At the hospital or surgery center</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Bring a picture ID.</li>
        <li>You will be kept comfortable and safe by your anesthesia provider. You may get medicine that 
          relaxes you or puts you in a light sleep. The area being worked on will be numb.</li>
        <li>After the procedure, pressure will be applied to the area where the catheter was put in your blood 
          vessel. Then the area may be covered with a bandage or a compression device. This will prevent bleeding.</li>
        <li>Nurses will check your heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse will also check the catheter site for bleeding.</li>
        <li>If the catheter was put in your groin, you will need to lie still and keep your leg straight for several 
          hours. The nurse may put a weighted bag on your leg.</li>
        <li>You may have a bruise or a small lump where the catheter was put in your blood vessel. This is normal and will go away.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>When should you call your doctor?</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You have questions or concerns.</li>
        <li>You don't understand how to prepare for your procedure.</li>
        <li>You become ill before the procedure (such as fever, flu, or a cold).</li>
        <li>You need to reschedule or have changed your mind about having the procedure.</li>
      </ul>
