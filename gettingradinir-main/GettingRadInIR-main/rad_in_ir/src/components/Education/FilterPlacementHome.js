      <h4><b>Your Recovery</b></h4>
      A vena cava filter was put into the vena cava using a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that was inserted through a vein in 
      your neck or groin. A vena cava filter may help prevent blood clots from traveling to the lungs, where they may block 
      blood flow. The filter may be permanent, or it may be removed later.
      <br />
      Vena cava filters may be used if you can't take a medicine (called a blood thinner) that prevents blood clots.
      <br />
      After having a vena cava filter placed, you may feel tired and have some pain for several days. You may have a small 
      bandage where the catheter was placed.
      <br />
      This care sheet gives you a general idea about how long it will take for you to recover. But each person recovers at a 
      different pace. Follow the steps below to feel better as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4><b>How can you care for yourself at home?</b></h4>
      <b>Activity</b>
      <ul>
        <li>If the doctor gave you a sedative:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>For 24 hours, don't do anything that requires attention to detail, such as going to work, 
            making important decisions, or signing any legal documents. It takes time for the medicine's 
            effects to completely wear off.</li>
          <li>For your safety, do not drive or operate any machinery that could be dangerous. Wait until 
            the medicine wears off and you can think clearly and react easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Do not do strenuous exercise and do not lift, pull, or push anything heavy until your doctor says it 
          is okay. This may be for a couple of days. You can walk around the house and do light activity, 
          such as cooking.</li>
        <li>If the catheter was placed in your groin, try not to walk up stairs for the first couple of days.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Diet</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You can eat your normal diet. If your stomach is upset, try bland, low-fat foods like plain rice, 
          broiled chicken, toast, and yogurt.</li>
        <li>If you had dye injected during the procedure, drink plenty of fluids to help your body flush out the 
          dye. If you have kidney, heart, or liver disease and have to limit fluids, talk with your doctor 
          before you increase the amount of fluids you drink.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Medicines</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Your doctor will tell you if and when you can restart your medicines. You will also be given 
          instructions about taking any new medicines.</li>
        <li>If you take aspirin or some other blood thinner, ask your doctor if and when to start taking it 
          again. Make sure that you understand exactly what your doctor wants you to do.</li>
        <li>Be safe with medicines. Take pain medicines exactly as directed.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it as prescribed.</li>
          <li>If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an 
            over-the-counter medicine.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If you think your pain medicine is making you sick to your stomach:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Take your medicine after meals (unless your doctor has told you not to).</li>
          <li>Ask your doctor for a different pain medicine.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <b>Care of the catheter site</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep a bandage over the spot where the catheter was inserted for the first day, or for as long as 
          your doctor recommends.</li>
        <li>Put ice or a cold pack on the area for 10 to 20 minutes at a time to help with soreness or s
          welling. Do this every few hours. Put a thin cloth between the ice and your skin.</li>
        <li>You may shower 24 to 48 hours after the procedure, if your doctor okays it. Pat the incision dry</li>
        <li>Do not soak the catheter site until it is healed. Don't take a bath for 1 week, or until your doctor 
          tells you it is okay.</li>
        <li>Watch for bleeding from the site. A small amount of blood (up to the size of a quarter) on the 
          bandage can be normal.</li>
        <li>If you are bleeding, lie down and press on the area for 15 minutes to try to make it stop. If the 
          bleeding does not stop, call your doctor or seek immediate medical care.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety.</b> Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your 
      doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the 
      medicines you take.
    </p>
    <p>

      <ul>
        <li>You have pain that does not get better after you take pain medicine.</li>
        <li>You are bleeding through your dressing. A small amount of bleeding is normal.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Increased pain, swelling, warmth, or redness.</li>
          <li>Red streaks leading from the incision.</li>
          <li>Pus draining from the incision.</li>
          <li>A fever.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>You have signs of a blood clot in your leg (called a deep vein thrombosis), such as:</li>

          <li>Redness and swelling in your leg.</li>
