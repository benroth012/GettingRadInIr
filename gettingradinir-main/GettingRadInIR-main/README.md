# GettingRadInIR

This application consists of two main subdirectories - rad_ir_ir and rad_in_ir_server. rad_in_ir consists of the front-end, made with React, and rad_in_ir_server consists of the back-end, made with Java Spring Boot. These two directories are meant to be run separately, at the same time, so that they can interact with each other.

Therefore, you can find separate running instructions within their respective READMEs located at the top level of the two directories.
